# Computation DAG Generator

Computation DAG generator is a tool to automate the process of computation directed acyclic graph generation task.

## The objectives of this project
- Design and implement an application to represent the computation DAG for a user input recursive algorithm  
- Provide a graphical view of the processing of the recursive algorithm  
- Automate the process for accept an algorithm, process it and design the computation DAG  
- Understanding the allocation of the threads for each sub problem in the recursive algorithm is an objective
